# Software exercise 1-2: Using QGIS with NetLogo (30 minutes)
### Teaching materials are prepared by Dr Heeseo Rain Kwon (heeseo.kwon.10@ucl.ac.uk). 

## Download and install QGIS
- Please download and install `QGIS 3.28 LTR` according to your platform: [QGIS Download Page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#){:target="_blank"}.

### Example 1: Preparing spatial input data on QGIS for an urban growth model
- As an example of an urban growth model, we will use [Isobenefit Urbanism morphogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479719307571){:target="_blank"} currently being reimplemented by H.R.Kwon (2023) as part of a project led by Dr Tommaso Gabrieli at UCL. 
- We will use data of a small part of [New Forest District](https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+Forest+District/){:target="_blank"} which includes Milford on Sea and Lymington.

1. Download boundary map of the case area: [ward_milford_lymington.zip](https://github.com/heeseorain/mini_module_abm/blob/master/data/ward_milford_lymington.zip){:target="_blank"} and save it in your working directory (e.g. your "mini_module_abm" folder). Extract the zip file.
- Note: This boundary map is extracted from the [Ordinance Survey Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/BoundaryLine). If you're interested in accessing spatial data for different parts of UK, OS Data Hub is a good source.

2. Download land use map of the case area: [ukland_4841866_milford_lymington.zip](https://github.com/heeseorain/mini_module_abm/blob/master/data/ukland_4841866_milford_lymington.zip){:target="_blank"} and save it in your working directory (e.g. your "mini_module_abm" folder). Extract the zip file.
- Note: This land use map is extracted from the "UKLand" data of [Verisk Data Download](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/roam/download/verisk){:target="_blank"}. [Edina Digimap](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/) is a great source for spatial data - if you're interested, log in with your UCL account and try exploring what's available.
